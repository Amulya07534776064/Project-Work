# E-Commerce Churn Prediction
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project aims to predict customer churn in the ecommerce sector using machine learning models. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon of customers stopping their engagement with a business. Identifying the factors that lead to churn and predicting it in advance can help ecommerce businesses improve customer retention strategies.

The project focuses on using various machine learning algorithms to analyze customer behavior, identify potential churn factors, and predict which customers are likely to stop using the platform.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
Identify key factors causing customer churn in the ecommerce industry.
Understand the impact of customer churn on business performance.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights from the dataset.
Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer churn.
Suggest strategies to improve customer retention.

DATASET:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, containing customer information and engagement patterns from an ecommerce platform. Key variables include:
Gender
City Tier
Distance from Home
Login Device
Number of Devices Registered
Satisfaction Score
Marital Status
Order Frequency
Cashback Amount
The dataset has 5630 rows and around 20 columns.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Python: Programming language
Jupyter Notebook: For code development and testing
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Machine learning models

APPROACH:
Data Collection: The dataset was collected from Kaggle.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
EDA: Visualizing the data to identify patterns and relationships.
Model Building: Training various machine learning models like:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Model Evaluation: Comparing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

RESULTS:
The best-performing model achieved [X% accuracy] in predicting customer churn. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations can be found in the notebooks/ directory.

DATA SECURITY & ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
The dataset used does not contain sensitive information. All data is stored securely using Google Cloud and shared via secure methods. Ethical guidelines were strictly followed during data collection and processing.
